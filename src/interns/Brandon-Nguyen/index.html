          Hello! My name is Brandon and to the left is a picture of me trying indoor skydiving for the first time. My girlfriend and I went 
          indoor skydiving as her birthday present of last year and it was super fun (10/10 would recommend if you're too scared to jump out 
          a real plane like me). I chose this picture because this was the last fun thing I did before the whole pandemic started and I can't
          wait for it to be over so that we can do things like this again. </p>
      <p> 
          My main goal for any internship is to learn as much as I can! After my previous internship, I realized that there is so much that 
          they don't teach you in a classroom and the only way to learn it is by working with it. I'm fairly early on in my career as a 
          software engineer so I would love to have the chance to learn from the experienced engineers at Lob! This could be anything from 
          using new technologies, to learning new software practices, or learning new things about the work culture! I am very hard working and driven
          so I am up for any new challenges this internship could bring me!
      </p>
      <p>
          I want to be a software engineer because I love to build things. I believe that I am a pretty creative person and software engineering
          allows me to create whatever I want at the tip of my fingers. This can be shown in some of my projects which can be found on my Github
          (https://github.com/bknguyen1999) like my Chess game where I implemented a Call of Duty game mode which adds in kill streaks into a
          typical game of chess. I also have a video player which syncs a Youtube video across all users and allows them to watch the video together.
          The reason why I made this video player was to allow me and my friends to interact and watch videos/movies together during quarantine
          since we couldn't see each other in person.
      </p>
      <p>
          I believe that my hard work ethic, knowledge, and experience would be a great fit at Lob and I would love to hear back from you guys soon!
          Also, this was a very interesting pre-application coding assessment. I've never done anything like this before and I think it was
          very unique, and I had a lot of fun doing it. Thank you!
